Located at the mouth of the energetic Chaliyar River, this town is covered in vibrant shades of green and surrounded by mystic shades of blue. When under the reign of Tipu Sultan, who was the ruler of Mysore, this town was named Sultan Pattanam.

                                                                          In spite of being a small town, it is very famous for ship-building. The shipbuilding yard here is renowned for the construction of Urus and Dhows, the traditional Arabian trading vessel. This craft is over 1500 years old now and is carried out carefully by the expert craftsmen who possess extraordinary skills.

Also, the sturdy wooden barges sailed across the Suez Canal during the reign of Cleopatra are also said to have been made at Beypore. What is mind-boggling is that no matter how big or complicated the ship to be built is, no formal plan or design or sketches is ever made All these computations are always in mind and at the fingertips of the foreman.</center></p>
